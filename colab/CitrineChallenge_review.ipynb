Say a team leader isn't satisfied with how new points are generated. Modularity allows a team to go into the library, find the module which is in charge of generating the data points, and tinker with it as necessary.\n",

This is why documentation is also key. Keying off our previous example, if a user whats to understand how the generator function works:"
